## How to contribute
Fixes for bugs, refactoring for efficiency, or simple reporting of poor performance such as errors are truly appreciated for the betterment of the program. The following enumerate several ways to contribute to this project:

### By reporting bugs

When filing your bug, please be as precise as possible. Bugs that can be reproduced by anyone are much easier to fix. If you can, please include a minimal test case that demonstrates the bug. This makes it much easier to track down the bug.

### By writing code

If you want to contribute code, you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

It is generally recommended that you create an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mrwnmncd/peter-parking/issues) on GitHub before you start working on writing codes. This allows us to discuss the feature and make sure that it is something that we want to add to the project. 

The flow will look something like this:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)
3. Write your change
4. Test your change
5. Submit a Pull Request

We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.
